        <h2>Who was Cassian Andor?</h2>

        <p>
          Cassian Jeron Andor was a human male operative of the Alliance to
          Restore the Republic who was remembered as a hero after his sacrifice
          to secure the Galactic Empire's Death Star plans at the Battle of
          Scarif. An accomplished spy and assassin, Andor was well-respected
          within the Rebellion and was trusted with leading Alliance
          Intelligence missions by Alliance High Command.
